    <h2>About SindhiSpark</h2>

    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>SindhiSpark was born out of a desire to keep the flame of Sindhiyat alive — its stories, traditions, and vibrant culture. In a world rushing forward, this space serves as a gentle reminder of our roots.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>To celebrate, preserve, and share Sindhi culture globally — from timeless literature and folk tales, to delicious recipes, colorful festivals, and the rising voices of Sindhi youth.</p>

    <h3>About the Creator</h3>
    <p>We are Mahek and Kabir Peswani, two young students deeply connected to our roots. SindhiSpark is our humble tribute to our ancestors, our language, and our community — a platform where tradition meets the voices of today.</p>

    <h3>Why SindhiSpark?</h3>
    <p>Because every thread of Sindhiyat deserves to shine — in every story told, every poem translated, every recipe shared, and every young dream empowered.</p>
